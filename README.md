# General Notes on Project Documentation 

Documentation will be included in the project GitHub repository in an agreed format such as slides or doc or the github wiki or github issues. Documentation includes:

## A. Project Diagrams

Documentation will include project diagrams provided by MIT depicting key roles, interactions and workflow of the prototype applications and a brief description of how the UI and UX reflects the information contained in the diagram.

# B. Project Demonstrations

The demo slides and screen walkthrough video will show two key actions, namely 1. Digital signatures used to sign legal contracts and notices are publicly verifiable by use of the public key associated with a Bitcoin and/or Ethereum public blockchains address associated with the signer; and 2. Digitally signed contracts and legal notices accessible at a standard URL on the web in the form of human readable pure text files.

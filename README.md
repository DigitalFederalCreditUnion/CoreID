# CoreID

For MIT Media Lab Human Dynamics group open source prototyping and other research and development related to business, legal and technology dimensions of blockchain-backed individual identity

## CoreID demo

For demonstration purposes and relative ease of use we utilize the the Bitcoin Core internal wallet and rpc commands to do all signing within the application. 

## Getting Started

* Download BitCoin Core Binaries

* Unpack and run ./bitcoind with proper configurations based on what you want to do (eg do you want to connect to "mainnet" or the "testnet" or "regtest" if you just want to play around with the tools and not be connected to anything for example?)

* NPM install 

*
